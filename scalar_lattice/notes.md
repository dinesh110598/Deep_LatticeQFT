- Mixture of logistic distributions seems like a good replacement for a mixture of gaussians to model scalar lattice field theory- nope, both are equally non-reparameterizable
- I could probably try using left and up streams just like PixelCNN does but that approach becomes unfeasible for higher dimensions
