\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on autoregressive networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The autoregressive relation and systems with nearest neighbour interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our system of interest is a lattice field of scalar values 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at every position 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}$
\end_inset

 in a 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional box of length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}\in[1,L]^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 We assume open boundary conditions so 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mu}<1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mu}>L$
\end_inset

 do not exist for any component 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The lattice field configurations are distributed according to the 
\emph on
Boltzmann distribution
\emph default
:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(\{\phi(\bm{x})\}_{\bm{x}\in[1,L]^{d}}\right)=e^{-S[\phi]}/Z\label{eq:boltzmann}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S[\phi]$
\end_inset

 is a functional over the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is the normalizing constant sometimes known as partition function.
 Instead of using lattice vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}\in[1,L]^{d}$
\end_inset

, we can use an 
\emph on
ordering
\emph default
 of them, given by positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in[1,L^{d}]$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
k & =\left({\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{d}}(x_{i}-1)L^{i-1}\right)+1\label{eq:ordering}\\
\implies p(\{\phi_{k}\}_{k\in[1,N]}) & =e^{-S[\phi]}/Z\label{eq:probability}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N=L^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 From the chain rule of conditional probability- a generalized version of
 Bayes theorem that also goes by the name 
\emph on
autoregressive relation
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can be factorized into N conditional terms:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(\{\phi_{k}\}) & =p(\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\dots\phi_{N})=p(\phi_{1})p(\phi_{2}|\phi_{1})\dots p(\phi_{N}|\phi_{N-1}\dots\phi_{2},\phi_{1})\nonumber \\
 & =\prod_{k\in[1,N]}p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})\label{eq:chainrule}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The advantage of this expression is that we can sequentially sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=N$
\end_inset

 if we know the conditional probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

 in the RHS, is often simpler than the Boltzmann distribution since the
 latter depend on one variable at a time.
 However, exact form of the conditional 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

 is unknown- especially for arbitrary choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $S[\phi]$
\end_inset

.
 For our study, let's specialize 2 different systems for our choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $S[\phi]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Ising model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the nearest neighbour Ising model with constant couplings 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 and inverse temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S[\phi]$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S[\phi]=-\beta J\sum_{\mu=1}^{d}\sum_{x_{\nu=\mu}\in[2,L],x_{\nu\neq\mu}\in[1,L]}\phi(\bm{x}-\hat{\mu})\phi(\bm{x})\label{eq:ising_action}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\bm{x})$
\end_inset

 can only take the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

.
 So the conditionals 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

 are modelled by categorical distributions with one independent parameter.
 We've deliberately written 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ising_action"

\end_inset

 in a form that strictly respects the open boundary conditions we've assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Scalar lattice field theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the scalar lattice field theory, 
\begin_inset Formula $S[\phi]$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
action
\emph default
 given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S[\phi]={\displaystyle \sum_{\bm{x}\in[1,L]^{d}}}\left[\frac{1}{a^{2}}\phi(\bm{x}){\displaystyle \sum_{\bm{y}}}\boxempty(\bm{x},\bm{y})\phi(\bm{y})+m^{2}\phi(\bm{x})^{2}+\lambda\phi(\bm{x})^{4}\right]\label{eq:latticeFT-action}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 are the lattice spacing, mass and coupling respectively.
 For the open boundary, we must expand the d'Alembertian term in the RHS
 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\displaystyle \sum_{\bm{x}\in[1,L]^{d}}}\phi(\bm{x}){\displaystyle \sum_{\bm{y}}}\boxempty(\bm{x},\bm{y})\phi(\bm{y})=\sum_{\mu=1}^{d}\sum_{x_{\nu=\mu}\in[2,L-1],x_{\nu}\neq[1,L]}2\phi(\bm{x})^{2}-\phi(\bm{x})\phi(\bm{x}-\hat{\mu})-\phi(\bm{x})\phi(\bm{x}+\hat{\mu})
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\bm{x})$
\end_inset

 can take any real value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crucial common feature between the 2 systems is that there's only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interactions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between neighbouring values and the dependence is specifically of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\bm{x})\phi(\bm{x}-\hat{\mu})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Smaller dependency sets due to nearest neighbour interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's order our lattice points according to the ordering in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ordering"

\end_inset

.
 Examining the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

th conditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

, its distribution in general depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 values in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<k}=\{\phi_{k-1},\dots\phi_{1}\}$
\end_inset

.
 This means the complexity of these distributions can explode if the number
 of lattice points 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is large, which is typically the case of interest.
 That's the reason deep neural networks have been utilized to model them
 so far.
 However for systems with nearest neighbour interactions, the 
\emph on
dependency set
\emph default
 is significantly smaller, and doesn't even increase with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 after a certain point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll work with the Ising model- the analysis can be generalized to lattice
 field theory and any system with only nearest neighbour interactions.
 Restating the autoregressive relation for the Ising model
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula $k-\hat{\mu}$
\end_inset

 should be understood as the lattice position 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}-\hat{\mu}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{x}$
\end_inset

 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 according to the given ordering
\end_layout

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\prod_{k=1}^{N}p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})=p(\phi)=\exp\left(-\beta J\sum_{\mu=1}^{d}\sum_{k}\phi_{k}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}\right)/Z\label{eq:log_autoreg}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In order to determine the dependency set, let's start backwards from with
 the distribution for the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

th spin 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{N}|\phi_{<N})$
\end_inset

 where other all spins are known.
 We can cluster together every other term in the above equation in the form
 an unconditional probability using Bayes theorem:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})=p(\phi_{<N})
\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{N}|\phi_{<N})p(\phi_{<N})=p(\phi)
\]

\end_inset

and the unconditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\log p(\phi_{<N})$
\end_inset

 can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{<N})=\sum_{\phi_{N}}p(\phi)=\sum_{\phi_{N}}\exp\left(-\beta J\sum_{\mu=1}^{d}\sum_{k}\phi_{k}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}\right)/Z
\]

\end_inset

which leads to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{N}|\phi_{<N})=\frac{p(\phi)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N}}}p(\phi)}=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}{\displaystyle \sum_{k}}\phi_{k}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N}}}\exp\left(-\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}{\displaystyle \sum_{k}}\phi_{k}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

Here, every term cancels between the numerator and denominator except the
 ones that multiply or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interact with
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{N}$
\end_inset

, since addition within exponentials beautifully factors outside:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{N}|\phi_{<N})=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}+\delta(\phi_{<N})\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N}}}\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}+\delta(\phi_{<N})\right)}=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N}}}\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

So 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{N}|\phi_{<N})$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on all the 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 values within 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<N}$
\end_inset

 but only the 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 neighbouring values 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}$
\end_inset

.
 Proceeding to the next term:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p(\phi_{N-1}|\phi_{<N-1}) & =\frac{p(\phi_{<N})}{p(\phi_{<N-1})}=\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N}}}\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}+-\beta J\phi_{N-1}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-1-\hat{\mu}}+\delta(\phi_{<N-1})\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\phi_{N-1}}}\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}+-\beta J\phi_{N-1}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-1-\hat{\mu}}+\delta(\phi_{<N-1})\right)}\\
 & =\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N}}}\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}+-\beta J\phi_{N-1}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-1-\hat{\mu}}\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\phi_{N-1}}}\exp\left(-\beta J\phi_{N}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-\hat{\mu}}+-\beta J\phi_{N-1}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu=1}^{d}}\phi_{N-1-\hat{\mu}}\right)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and this depends on the neighbours of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{N-1}$
\end_inset

.
 In general, we have for 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k}) & =\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\dots\phi_{k+1}}}\exp\left(-\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{l=k}^{N}}\left(\phi_{l}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{l-\hat{\mu}}\right)\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\dots\phi_{k}}}\exp\left(-\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{l=k}^{N}}\left(\phi_{l}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{l-\hat{\mu}}\right)\right)}\label{eq:ising_k_conditional}
\end{align}

\end_inset

and the dependency set here contains the values of neighbours of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{>k}$
\end_inset

 contained within 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<k}$
\end_inset

.
 The number of elements in the dependency set is bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{d-1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $N/L$
\end_inset

 (due to some geometric constraints, see figure ) which is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

order of magnitude
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 smaller than the original upper bound 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (coloured white), within

\begin_layout Subsection
Effective size of dependency set depends on the values of hyperparameters
 of the system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
High temperature expansion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's work in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\to0$
\end_inset

 for the Ising model.
 Intuitively speaking, the spins are expected to behave (or distributed)
 independently at the high temperature limit:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi)\approx\prod_{k}p(\phi_{k})
\]

\end_inset

For a better approximation, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 small in the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ising_k_conditional"

\end_inset

 gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k}) & =\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\dots\phi_{k+1}}1-\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{l=k}^{N}}\left(\phi_{l}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{l-\hat{\mu}}\right)+\mathbb{\mathcal{O}}(\beta^{2})}}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\dots\phi_{k}}1-\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{l=k}^{N}}\left(\phi_{l}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{l-\hat{\mu}}\right)}+\mathbb{\mathcal{O}}(\beta^{2})}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Separating out terms containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the numerator and expanding sums over 1:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})\approx\frac{2^{N-k}-\beta J\phi_{k}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}-{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\dots\phi_{k+1}}\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{l=k+1}^{N}}\left(\phi_{l}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{l-\hat{\mu}}\right)}}{2^{N-k+1}-{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{N},\dots\phi_{k+1}}\beta J{\displaystyle \sum_{l=k}^{N}}\left(\phi_{l}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{l-\hat{\mu}}\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

The terms in the brackets vanish since we symmetrically sum over 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 on all of them, giving:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})=0.5-\frac{\beta}{2}J\phi_{k}{\displaystyle \sum_{\mu}}\phi_{k-\hat{\mu}}+\mathcal{O}(\beta^{2})
\]

\end_inset

so when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is small, there's an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$
\end_inset

 dependence on the nearest neighbours while the rest are even smaller.
 So assuming that the dependency set for 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
effectively 
\emph default
consists only of the nearest neighbours can be a good approximation for
 a small 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Slowly increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\beta^{2})$
\end_inset

 terms become significant, and some more math digging would reveal terms
 of that order include terms of the forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{2}J^{2}\phi_{k}^{2}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}-\hat{\nu}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{2}J^{2}\phi_{k}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}}^{2}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}-\hat{\nu}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{2}J^{2}\phi_{k}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}+\hat{\nu}}\phi_{k+\hat{\mu}+\hat{\nu}-\hat{\sigma}}$
\end_inset

 that are within 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<k}$
\end_inset

, which we could interpret as spins within 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<k}$
\end_inset

 that can be reached via/contained within a path of length 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 inside 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{>k}$
\end_inset

.
 This practically includes second/third nearest neighbours of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Recursing this logic, we can conclude that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 grows the effective dependency set to an 
\emph on
upper bound
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N/L$
\end_inset

 positions as we inferred from the previous section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Low temperature expansion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at the other extreme, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Let's set 
\begin_inset Formula $J=-1$
\end_inset

 representing ferromagnetic couplings for simplicity.
 For this low temperature limit, it's useful to start with with the so-called
 ground state where all spins in the dependency set within 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<k}$
\end_inset

 are aligned (
\begin_inset Formula $=+1$
\end_inset

 wlog).
 We then have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k}=1)=\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{>k}=\pm1}}\exp\beta\left(d\phi_{k}+{\displaystyle \sum}\overleftrightarrow{\phi}_{>k}+{\displaystyle \sum}\left(\overleftrightarrow{\phi}_{>k}\tilde{\phi}_{>k}+\tilde{\phi}_{>k}\tilde{\phi}_{>k}\right)\right)}{{\displaystyle \sum_{\phi_{\geq k}=\pm1}}\exp\beta\left(d\phi_{k}+{\displaystyle \sum}\overleftrightarrow{\phi}_{>k}+{\displaystyle \sum}\left(\overleftrightarrow{\phi}_{>k}\tilde{\phi}_{>k}+\tilde{\phi}_{>k}\tilde{\phi}_{>k}\right)\right)}\label{eq:low_t_ground_state}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overleftrightarrow{\phi}_{>k}$
\end_inset

 are the spins within 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{>k}$
\end_inset

 that are adjecent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{<k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\phi}_{>k}$
\end_inset

 are the remaining spins in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{>k}$
\end_inset

.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the summation term for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{>k}=1$
\end_inset

 is exponentially larger than any permutation term assigning 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

s on both the numerator and denominator, giving us the series expansions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k}=1)=\frac{{\displaystyle \exp\beta\left(2d\phi_{k}+N-k-1\right)}+c_{1}\exp\beta(2d\phi_{k}+N-k-1-2d)+\mathcal{O}(e^{-4\beta d})}{\exp\beta\left(2d+N-k-1\right)+c'_{1}\exp\beta\left(N-k-1\right)+c'_{2}\exp\beta\left(-2d+N-k-1\right)+\mathcal{O}(e^{-3\beta d})}
\]

\end_inset

where flipping one spin to 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 inside 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{>k}$
\end_inset

 has an energy penalty of 
\begin_inset Formula $-2d$
\end_inset

 hence the expansion with successive terms in both the numerator and denominator
 getting smaller.
 Clearly, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}=1|\phi_{<k})=e^{2\beta d}p(\phi_{k}=-1|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

 in the ground state.
 What if a neighbouring value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

 is flipped (first excited state)? Then we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:low_t_ground_state"

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $d-2$
\end_inset

 and we yield a similar expansion but end the result being 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}=1|\phi_{<k})=e^{2\beta(d-2)}p(\phi_{k}=-1|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

.
 How much does this odds depend on flipping other spins in the dependency
 set? That requires expansions with larger number of terms than the one
 above but we'll eventually see that they don't affect the odds unless we
 crank 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 down to smaller values such that flipping multiple spins have small enough
 
\begin_inset Formula $-2\beta d$
\end_inset

 penalty for each spin.
 So reducing 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
increases
\emph default
 the effective dependency set from just nearest neighbours to include more
 positions until an upper bound of 
\begin_inset Formula $N/L$
\end_inset

 Why start from ground state since 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{k}|\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

 would require no such assumptions? Even if it turns out that our conclusion
 of strongest neighbour dependency is wrong for states far from the ground
 state, we are not bothered since these configurations are exponentially
 less likely to be actually encountered while sampling using an autoregressive
 process at low temperatures, according to the unconditional distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi_{<k})$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We've waved hands in showing a stronger neighbourhood dependency compared
 to farther ones for the conditional probabilities at both high and low
 temperature limits.
 In particular, the effective dependency set is the smallest at both limits,
 and it grows as we move away from them.
 And its not a mystery to anyone who has worked with the Ising model before
 that there's a phase transition or critical point at an intermediate temperatur
e when 
\begin_inset Formula $d\geq2$
\end_inset

 and the same goes for lattice field theory as well (even though we suspect
 similar high and low temperature expansions would be substantially harder).
 A curious feature about phase transition in the Ising model is there's
 another quantity 
\emph on
correlation length
\emph default
 that displays the same behaviour of growing away from both the high and
 low temperature limits.
 The goal of this study is to verify the relationship between correlation
 length and the minimum number of inputs (within the dependency set) required
 for an autoregressive neural network to model the target distribution to
 arbitrary accuracy.
